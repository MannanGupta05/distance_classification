Concise Summary of Findings and Learnings from the Project
Through the use of a Haar Cascade classifier on greyscale images, the extraction of average hue and saturation features in HSV colour space, and the application of K-Means clustering, the project was able to successfully classify faces into two groups. The results were displayed in a scatter plot with centroids. An effective and repeatable workflow was ensured by tools like WandB, GitHub, and Docker, which supported experiment tracking, version control, and containerisation. This method successfully illustrated the effectiveness of fusing clustering and image processing methods for face classification.
